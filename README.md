# Learn OpenGL

This is a rewrite of the original code from the [Learn
OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) book by Joey de Vries. The original code is
available [here](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). The goal was to
integrate the OpenGL code in a more powerful GUI framework, and rewrite using
more contemporary DSA syntax for OpenGL. The project uses GTK 4 with C++
bindings (gtkmm). Old OpenGL syntax was left as is in the first example, but
starts on from the first exercise.
